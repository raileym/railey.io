<h3>Hypergeometric Distribution.</h3>
<p>The <strong>hypergeometric distribution</strong> is a discrete probability distribution that describes the probability of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> successes (random draws for which the object drawn has a specified feature) in <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> draws, without replacement, from a finite population of size <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> that contains exactly <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> objects with that feature, wherein each draw is either a success or a failure <span class="citation">(Wikipedia 2020a)</span>.</p>

<h3>Negative Binomial Distribution.</h3>
<p>A <strong>negative binomial distribution</strong> is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of [failures] in a sequence of independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials before a specified [fixed] number of [successes] … occurs <span class="citation">(Wikipedia 2020b)</span> (corrected).</p>

<h3>Poisson Distribution.</h3>
<p>A <strong>poisson distribution</strong> is a discrete probability distribution that describes the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space if these events occur with a known constant mean rate and independently of the time since the last event <span class="citation">(Wikipedia 2020c)</span>.</p>
