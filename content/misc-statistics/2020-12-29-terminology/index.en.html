<p>This post seeks to describe precisely the notation and concepts surrounding probability and random variables.</p>
<p><strong>An event is assigned a probability <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</strong></p>
<p>The probability of event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is based on repeating an experiment a number of times, e.g., <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> times. If we count the number of times that event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> occurs throughout these <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> experiments, then the frequency of event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{N}(A)\)</span>. The ratio <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{N}(A)/n\)</span> is called the relative frequency of event A in these <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> repetitions of the experiment. For large values of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, this relative frequency approaches a stable value, which we will designate as <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> <span class="citation">(Hogg and Tanis 2010, 12)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Probability of an event is <span class="math inline">\(P(A)\)</span>.</strong></p>
<p>The number <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> assigned to event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is called the probability of event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and is denoted by <span class="math inline">\(P(A)\)</span> <span class="citation">(Hogg and Tanis 2010, 13)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome space of an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes.</strong></p>
<p>We begin with a random experiment: the flip of a fair coin. The top-facing emblem of the coin is observed. The set of possible outcomes is <strong>head</strong> and <strong>tail</strong>. Thus, the <strong>outcome space</strong> <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> for this experiment is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
S = \{\text{head}, \text{tail}\}.
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>A random variable is a mapping.</strong></p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a function defined on [the same] <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(X(\text{head})=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X(\text{tail})=1\)</span>. Here, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a real-valued function that has the space <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> as its domain and the set of real numbers <span class="math inline">\(\{x:x=0, 1\}\)</span> as its range.</p>
<p>We call <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> a <strong>random variable</strong>, and, for this example, the set <span class="math inline">\(\{x:x=0, 1\}\)</span> the <strong>space</strong> associated with <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>

<span id="def:unnamed-chunk-1" class="definition"><strong>Definition 1  (random variable)  </strong></span>
<br/><br/>Given a random experiment with an outcome space <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, a function <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> that assigns one and only one real number <span class="math inline">\(X(s) = x\)</span> to an element <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is called a <strong>random variable</strong>. The [outcome] <strong>space</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is the set of real numbers <span class="math inline">\(\{x: X(s) = x, s \in S\}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(s \in S\)</span> means that the element <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> belongs to the set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> <span class="citation">(Hogg and Tanis 2010, 51)</span>.

<hr />
<p><strong>Use <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> as the probability mass function</strong>.</p>
<p>For a discrete random variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, the probability $P(X=x) $is denoted by <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, and this function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is called the <strong>probability mass function</strong>, often abbreviated as <strong>p.m.f.</strong></p>
<hr />

<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:unnamed-chunk-2" class="definition"><strong>Definition 2  (probability mass function)  </strong></span>
<br/><br/>The <strong>probability mass function</strong> <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> of a discrete random variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a function that satisfies the following properties:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f(x) \gt 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x \in S;\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\sum_{x \in S} f(x) = 1\)</span>;</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(P(X \in A) = \sum_{x \in A} f(x)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(A \subset S\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="citation">(Hogg and Tanis 2010, 53)</span></p>
</div>

<hr />
<p>From the Definition 2 (probability mass function), it is understood that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
P(X=x) = f(x) \gt 0 \text{ when } x \in S
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Because <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> contains all the probabilities associated with <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, the set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is sometimes referred to as both the <strong>support</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and the <strong>space</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> <span class="citation">(Hogg and Tanis 2010, 53)</span>.</p>
