<div id="strategy" class="section level3">
<h3>STRATEGY</h3>
<ul>
<li>Download PDF for Lecture Notes Prior to listening to a lecture, and then install this PDF into Notability. In so doing, I can take notes as enabled by Notability.</li>
</ul>

<h3>ISSUE TO WATCH</h3>
<ul>
<li>Apparently, additional hand-outs will be posted to a particular area under Course / Week 0 / Handouts. I could not tell whether notifications will be made accordingly.</li>

<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Homework are difficult (to be expected). Homework assignments are due on the Friday of the week following their release. I like this because it gives me plenty of time to think through and solve the problems assigned.</p></li>
<li><p>Lecture notes will be explicitly keyed to particular homework assignment problems so that I will understand when I have received enough of the material to start these problems</p></li>
<li><p>Homework assignments are keyed to downloads, such as PDF files, so that I can work with the problems in a consolidated hard-copy form.</p></li>
<li><p>Lectures (videos) are keyed to Lecture Notes that can be downloaded, perhaps in the form of a PDF.</p></li>
<li><p>Professors consider completing homework assignments as very important. They consider the assignments as a minimum number to convey the material – they kept repetition in assignment particulars to a minimum.</p></li>
<li><p>Professors introduce NEW MATERIAL through the homework assignments. I will see how this works out.</p></li>
<li><p>All homework assignments are multiple choice. Apparently, the assignments will be difficult nonetheless.</p></li>
<li><p>In regards to <strong>quizzes</strong> you have 7-day time frame with which to take a quiz, but precisely 30-minutes to complete a quiz once you start. I will see how this goes. Be prepared before you start: have paper, pencil, calculator. Quizzes are open book, open notes. No memorization is expected.</p></li>
<li><p>There are two <strong>mid-terms</strong> for the course. The mid-terms are treated similar to quizzes except that you are given a 2-hour window during which to complete an exam. As with quizzes, mid-terms are open book, open notes, open calculator, open R.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>– In regards to quizzes and mid-terms, the professors request that you receive no help from others or from outside resources (I assume this to mean other people outside of the course).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>course syllabus</strong> clear states the dates for homework assignments, quizzes, and mid-terms along with their due dates.</p></li>
<li><p>Grades are set according to the following percentages: 30% homework assignments, 30% quizzes, 20% Midterm 1, and 20% Midterm 2.</p></li>
<li><p>As for the grading policy regarding homework assignments, you are free to drop your two lowest scores.</p></li>
<li><p>Interestingly, the professors state that their course co-mingles probability with statistics. This is to say that they will inter-splice major sections of each. I am curious as to how this will work. In Professor Müller’s introductory lecture, he displays a course outline that clearly shows how they plan to inter-splice their materials.</p></li>
