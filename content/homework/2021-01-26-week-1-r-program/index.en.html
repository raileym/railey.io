<p>This programming example illustrates how to create and graph the results from a random experiment in which a population is tested for an infection, where a test may yield a True Positive or a False Positive result.</p>
<p>We begin by setting our experiment parameters: the total population size of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and a known infection rate of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>    N = 50   # The population contains of N=1000 members.
    p = .8   # The infection rate for a population member is assumed to be p.</code></pre>
<p>Next, we create a vector <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> to represent a sample population where each element <span class="math inline">\(b_i \in B\)</span> corresponds to the health status of a population member <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, such that</p>
<div class="highlight transparent" style="font-size:0.7rem;color:#998;margin-left:2em">
<p><span class="math inline">\(b_i == 1\)</span> means member <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is infected, and <br/>
<span class="math inline">\(b_i == 0\)</span> means member <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is not infected (healthy).</p>
</div>
<p>Given the population size <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and an infection rate <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, we create vector <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> from values drawn randomly <em>with replacement</em> from a vector <span class="math inline">\(c(0,1)\)</span>, where we assign <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> with probability <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> with probability <span class="math inline">\(1-p\)</span>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>    # Create a random sample population from a vector c(0,1) where assigning
    # the value &#39;0&#39; denotes a healthy member whereas assigning a &#39;1&#39; denotes
    # an infected member of the population member.
    #
    B = sample(c(0,1), N, prob=c(1-p,p), replace=TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>Next, we assume a pair of likelihood values:
the probability of a positive test when a population member is infected,
and the probability of a positive test when they are not.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>    # Set likelihood for a positive test whether a member is
    # is infected or not.
    #
    pr_positive_test_when_infected = 0.999
    pr_positive_test_when_healthy  = 0.005</code></pre>
<p>For our random experiment, we begin with a vector <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> of random floating-point values selected in the range <span class="math inline">\((0,1)\)</span> using a uniform distribution.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>    # Generate N random (floating-point) numbers uniformly
    # in the default range (0,1).
    #
    u = runif(N)</code></pre>
<p>Now, we create a vector <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> that denotes our test results for our population <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, such that every element <span class="math inline">\(a_i \in A\)</span> corresponds to the test results of a population member <span class="math inline">\(b_i \in B\)</span> where</p>
<div class="highlight transparent" style="font-size:0.7rem;color:#998;margin-left:2em">
<p><span class="math inline">\(a_i == 1\)</span> means member <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is tested positive, and <br/>
<span class="math inline">\(a_i == 0\)</span> means member <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is tested negative.</p>
</div>
<p>In our random experiment, we consider the following conditional probabilities,</p>
<div class="highlight transparent" style="font-size:0.7rem;color:#998;margin-left:2em">
<p><span class="math inline">\(Pr(A|B == 0) == Pr( \text{positive test} | \text{member is healthy}),\)</span><br/>
<span class="math inline">\(Pr(A|B == 1) == Pr( \text{positive test} | \text{member is infected})\)</span></p>
</div>
<p>In one very short expression, we calculate the conditional probabilities above.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>    # Calculate the conditional probabilities
    #
    #    Pr(A|B == 0) = pr_positive_test_when_healthy
    #    Pr(A|B == 1) = pr_positive_test_when_infected, 
    #
    # Note, the following seriously abridged statement is equivalent
    # to the C-Language nested if-else statement,
    #
    # if (b == 1) {
    #
    #   // Assign &#39;1&#39; if &lt;, &#39;0&#39; otherwise.
    #   a = u &lt; pr_positive_test_when_infected;
    #
    # } else {
    #
    #   // Assign &#39;1&#39; if &lt;, &#39;0&#39; otherwise.
    #   a = u &lt; pr_positive_test_when_healthy;
    #
    # }
    #
    A = ifelse(B==1, u&lt;pr_positive_test_when_infected, u&lt;pr_positive_test_when_healthy)</code></pre>
<p>Given <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, we can calculate an empirical value for the conditional probability,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
Pr(B | A) = \frac{Pr(A \cap B)}{Pr(A)},
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>which expresses the probability that a population member is <em>indeed</em> sick given their test came back positive. In this case, credit to this conditional probability depends not only on how many members tested positive <span class="math inline">\(n(A)\)</span>, but also on whether that member who tested positive was actually sick.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>    nBA = sum(B &amp; A)    # Count the number of infected members who tested positive
    nA = sum(A)         # Count the number of members who tested positive
    pBgivenA = nBA/nA   # Compute Pr(B|A) as Pr(A&amp;B)/Pr(B)</code></pre>
<p>Wrapping this entire process into a single routine that runs as a function of infection rate <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and then invoking that function over a range of infection rates yields an interest result.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure <a href="#fig:ratio">1</a>, the conditional probability <span class="math inline">\(Pr(B|A)\)</span> is inversely proportional to the infection rate. This is to say that the greater the infection rate, the closer the conditional probability <span class="math inline">\(Pr(B|A)\)</span> comes to equalling the infection rate itself <span class="math inline">\(Pr(B)\)</span>. In short,</p>
<div class="highlight">
<p>As the true infection rate <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> increases, the conditional probability of the measured infection rate <span class="math inline">\(Pr(B|A)\)</span> approaches the measured infection rate <span class="math inline">\(Pr(B)\)</span> and as such becomes independent of the efficacy of the test.</p>
</div>
<p>From another view point, Figure <a href="#fig:constant">2</a> shows that the conditional probability <span class="math inline">\(Pr(B|A)\)</span> approaches a constant <span class="math inline">\(Pr(B)\)</span> for increasing values of infection rates <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
