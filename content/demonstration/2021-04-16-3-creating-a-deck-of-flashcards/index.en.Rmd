```{r setup, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
require(reticulate)
```

```{python, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, results="asis", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
sys.path.append('../../../assets/python')

from ctns_make import ctns_make as CTNS_MAKE
from ctns      import ctns as CTNS
```

I can list flashcards on one web page from top to bottom; or I can combine them into a single deck that a student can cycle through.

Because I am negotiating the movement of these flashcards using Javascript, I could (future) add the code to distinguish categories of flashcards (easier, harder, re-study). Using instrumentation, I can record what flashcards a student sees, whether they flip the card, how long the spend on a particular flashcard, and so forth. Using an ET Callhome scenario, I can punch this information out the door using AJAX to a receiving server for gathering instrumentation data.

Here is an example of a deck of flashcards.

```{python, eval=TRUE, results="asis", echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
m_list = [
    'ax.*S.*'
    #AssocS2, axAssocS3, axClosedS3'
]

for m in m_list:
#    CTNS_MAKE(match=m)
    CTNS(match=m, opt_ctns = [ 
        "flashcard" 
      , "quiz_container_css='width:100%;'"
      , "quiz" ])
```
