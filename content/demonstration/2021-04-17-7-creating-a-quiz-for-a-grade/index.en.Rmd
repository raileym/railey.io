```
Here is an example a graded quiz. As shown here, this quiz is shown top-to-bottom all on one page.

The CTNS script file for this example includes details on right and wrong answers. Try the quiz for yourself.

```{python, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, results="asis", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
sys.path.append('../../../assets/python')

from ctns_make import ctns_make as CTNS_MAKE
from ctns      import ctns as CTNS
```

```{python, eval=TRUE, results="asis", echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
m_list = [
    'num.*'
]

for m in m_list:
    #CTNS_MAKE(match=m)
    CTNS(match=m, opt_ctns = [ 
        "dynamic"
      , "rwu"
      , "quiz_css='width:100%;'"
    ])
```
