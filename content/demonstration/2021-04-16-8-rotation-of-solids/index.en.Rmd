```{r setup, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
require(reticulate)
```

```{python, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, results="asis", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
sys.path.append('../../../assets/python')

from ctns_make import ctns_make as CTNS_MAKE
from ctns      import ctns as CTNS
```

Here is an example of some serious lifting on the part of Javascript. I wrote this routine specifically for rotating solids examples that you would find in calculus. Javascript is quite capable. 

```{python, eval=TRUE, results="asis", echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
m_list = [
    '3d-prime-rotation-2curvesR1-1'
]

for m in m_list:
    CTNS_MAKE(match=m)
    CTNS(match=m, opt_ctns = [ 
    ])
```
