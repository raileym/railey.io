<p>This website is a running commentary on my study and practice of a new discipline, called <strong>Data Science</strong>. I call this discipline <strong>Applied Statistics</strong> when speaking to my friends and family.</p>
<p><strong>Spring 2021 – Let the games begin!</strong> I decided over a year ago to study data science formally through an academic program. To that end, I applied to and was accepted to (thankfully) the <a href="http://ms-datascience.utexas.edu/">Master of Science in Data Science Online</a> at the University of Texas at Austin.</p>
<p>I am motivated to attend UT Austin for several reasons, including UT’s commitment to a deep mathematical approach to applied statistics, not to mention my hometown attachment to UT Austin. To learn more about my decision, please see my first blog post on <a href="/post/why-i-decided-to-attend-the-university-of-texas-at-austin/">Why I decided to attend the University of Texas at Austin</a>.</p>
