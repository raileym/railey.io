This website is a running commentary on my study and practice of a new discipline, called **Data Science**. I call this discipline **Applied Statistics** when speaking to my friends and family.

**Spring 2021 -- Let the games begin!** I decided over a year ago to study data science formally through an academic program. To that end, I applied to and was accepted to (thankfully) the [Master of Science in Data Science Online](http://ms-datascience.utexas.edu/) at the University of Texas at Austin. 

I am motivated to attend UT Austin for several reasons, including UT's commitment to a deep mathematical approach to applied statistics, not to mention my hometown attachment to UT Austin. To learn more about my decision, please see my first blog post on [Why I decided to attend the University of Texas at Austin](/post/why-i-decided-to-attend-the-university-of-texas-at-austin/).
