This website is a running commentary on my study and practice of a new discipline called **data science**. I call this discipline **applied statistics** when speaking to my friends and family.

**New direction.** As noted below, I started a master's program in data science at a major university. I realized I was wholly unprepared for my first course within weeks -- I read the wrong textbooks in preparation. See [Change of course. Literally.](/post/change-of-course-literally/)

Because I find it nearly impossible to change course abruptly (i.e., on the first day of class), I decided to step aside for the moment. I am starting my path forward into data science; I am just not doing so formally at this time.

**Spring 2021 -- Let the games begin!** I decided over a year ago to study [data science](/post/why-i-want-to-be-a-data-scientist/) formally through an academic program. To that end, I am starting the [Master of Science in Data Science Online](http://ms-datascience.utexas.edu/) at the University of Texas at Austin. 

**Need for change.** For some time, I have been writing software to help kids learn math. After so many years to that end, I decided I needed a venue change: I like software engineering challenges but need a different path. I need new math and computer science challenges, including new programming languages, new tools, and new frameworks. For more on why I am affecting a change, see my post on [Why I want to be a data scientist](post/why-i-want-to-be-a-data-scientist/).

**Getting a degree.** While studying data science is not a stretch for me, doing so for a formal degree is: I already have a Ph.D. in Computer Science plus years of experience in software engineering. Learning a new topic is certainly not a surprise choice on my part. I have always been a life-long learner, studying new topics in technology, mathematics, and taxation. I buy used math books through Amazon, subscribe annually to [O'Reilly Learning Platform](https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/), and most recently signed up for [Coursera Plus](https://www.coursera.org/courseraplus). Nonetheless, I decided to take the plunge. To learn more, please see my post on [Why I chose to pursue a degree in data science](post/why-i-decided-to-pursue-a-degree-in-data-science/).

**Attending UT Austin.** Many universities offer graduate programs in data science online. So then the question is, where should I attend school. I am motivated to attend UT Austin for several reasons, including UT's commitment to an in-depth mathematical approach to applied statistics, not to mention my hometown attachment to UT Austin. To learn more about my decision, please see my post on [Why I decided to attend the University of Texas at Austin](/post/why-i-decided-to-attend-the-university-of-texas-at-austin/).
