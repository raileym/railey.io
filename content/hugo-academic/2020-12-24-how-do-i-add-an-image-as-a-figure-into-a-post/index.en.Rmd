When adding a <strong>figure</strong> to a post, my approach depends on the file type I am using. Because I mostly use **.Rmd** files, I will present my approach for .Rmd tile type here. I describe alternative approaches in another post, [Alternatives to how I add an image as a figure into a post](/hugo-academic/alternatives-to-how-i-add-an-image-as-a-figure-into-a-post).

In my posts, I include an image using the command **knitr::include_graphics()**:

```r
    knitr::include_graphics(<path-to-file>)
```

For example, I may invoke this command with the following parameters

```r 
    {r google-accounts, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Login screen for Google accounts.", out.width=400}
    knitr::include_graphics("images/1-login.png")
```

where **google-accounts** is an identifier for my R Chunk, **echo=FALSE** turns off the input display, **fig.cap="..."** is my figure caption, **out.width=400** is my desired width (in pixels), and **"images/1-login.png"** is the relative path to my PNG file.

Several caveats are in order:

- I am using the R Chunk identifier **google-accounts** as a means to cite my figure from within my post. I can cite my figure, e.g., **Figure \@ref(fig:google-accounts)**, using the syntax

```r
    \@ref(fig:google-accounts)
```

- The width parameter is dimensionless because HTML's IMG defaults to pixels for its height and width parameters.

- My relative path is relative to the *page bundle* [@Hugo2020] for my post. 

```r
   2020-12-24-how-do-i-add-an-image-as-a-figure-into-a-post
   ├── images
   │   └── 1-login.png
   ├── index.en.Rmd
   └── index.en.html
```

When I use the parameters above with the include_graphic command, I get a final result as shown below in **Figure \@ref(fig:google-accounts).**

```{r google-accounts, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Login screen for Google accounts.", out.width=400}
knitr::include_graphics("images/1-login.png")
```

There are several advantages to using **knitr::include_graphics()**:

- My invocation required only three lines, including the braces for Chunk R,
- The value of fig.cap maps to the value for **alt* for the HTML IMG tag,
- Knitr calculates the running figure # so I do not need to keep track,
- The named Chunk R is a back reference to the figure, as in **Figure \@ref(fig:google-accounts)**.
- Knitr will alter the include_graphic command depending on the output format

Btw, it was only after some time did trip over the approach described above. To give credit where credit is due, I found Harper [@Harper2018] recommended this approach on StackOverflow. I note that Harper's source for this information is buried in the documentation for Bookdown [@Xie2021a].
