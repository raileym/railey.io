We've all been there: you create a wonderful post of topic X only later to 
realize that you posted this post on topic X under section for topic Y. Argh!

Well, fear not. Correcting this mishap is not that hard. I will say, however,
that the easiest approach (I like easy) is to go under-the-hood within a
terminal session and use command-line operations to correct the issue.

In particular, always use cp, not mv. That is, use cp so that you can confirm
your details before you make (potentially) damaging corrections.

In fact, I may add alittle of bit git branches to help manage the error here.
