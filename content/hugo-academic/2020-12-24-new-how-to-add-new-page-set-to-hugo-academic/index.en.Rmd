The question here is, how to add an entirely new page section Z to your
Hugo-Academic website. This is to say that you want to add the following 
components to your site:

 - A new directory to hold a set of pages on topic Z
 - A menu reference that links to your list of pages on topic Z
 - A panel section on your home page specific to your posts on topic Z
 - A index file inside of your new directory of pages on topic Z
