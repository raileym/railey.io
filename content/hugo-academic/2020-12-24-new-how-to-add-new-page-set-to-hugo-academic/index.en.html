<p>The question here is, how to add an entirely new page section Z to your
Hugo-Academic website. This is to say that you want to add the following
components to your site:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new directory to hold a set of pages on topic Z</li>
<li>A menu reference that links to your list of pages on topic Z</li>
<li>A panel section on your home page specific to your posts on topic Z</li>
<li>A index file inside of your new directory of pages on topic Z</li>
</ul>
