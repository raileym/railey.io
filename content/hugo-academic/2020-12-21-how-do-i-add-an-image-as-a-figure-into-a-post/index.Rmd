This post describes how to insert an image into a post as a figure. Several approaches are shown.

### How do I include a figure in my post?

When adding a <strong>figure</strong> to your post, I recommend that you use the same expression -- the [{{< figure >}} shortcode by Hugo](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#figure) -- to describe both your figure and your link to an image. <strong>Figure 1</strong> is an example of one of my figures. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode(
  'figure', 
  src='/negative-binomial-distribution/example-1.png', 
  title='<strong>Figure 1.</strong> An example of a set of trials using a random variable with a negative binomial distribution.',
  caption='<strong>This is my caption</strong>')
```

How you invoke the {{< figure >}} shortcode depends on whether your post is a Markdown (.md) file or an R Markdown (.Rmd) file. For <strong>Figure 1</strong> above, I used the expression for R Markdown files with the help of the Blogdown command [blogdown::shortcode( )](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/content.html#shortcode), 

```r
blogdown::shortcode(
  'figure', 
  src='/negative-binomial-distribution/example-1.png',
  title='<strong>Figure 1.</strong> An example of a set of trials using a random variable with a Negative Binomial Distribution.',
  caption='<strong>This is my caption</strong>')
```

If you are using a regular Markdown file instead, then use the direct expression for {{< figure >}},

```r
{{< figure
    src="/negative-binomial-distribution/example-1.png"
    title="<strong>Figure 1.</strong> Negative Binomial Distribution."
    caption="This is my caption" >}}
```

### So where do I put my image?

In my case, I placed my image file -- a PNG file -- in my website's <strong>static</strong> directory further classified under a qualified directory <strong>/static/negative-binomial-distribution/</strong>,

    $(HOME)/railey.io/static/negative-binomial-distribution/

### RESEARCH LOCATIONS PLEASE.

### What about using a Markdown Link <strong>$\mathbf{![\text{title}](\text{url})}$</strong>?

Another approach to adding a <strong>figure</strong> to your post is to use a Markdown Link for URLs. See [Adam Pritchard's Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links) as a great reference for using links in a Markdown file.

For example, if I use a Markdown Link 

```r
![<strong>Figure 2.</strong> Negative binomial distribution.](/negative-binomial-distribution/example-1.png)
```

then I get an included figure as shown below in <strong>Figure 2,</strong>

![<strong>Figure 2.</strong> Negative binomial distribution.](/negative-binomial-distribution/example-1.png)

I like using a Markdown Link because the usage is clean and simple. Another great reference on Markdown Links is provided by [Gitlab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#links).

### What about including files from a Page Bundle?

```r
{{ with .Resources.ByType "image" }}
	<div class="Gallery">
		{{ range . }}
			<div class='Gallery__item'>
				<img src="{{ .RelPermalink }}" />
			</div>
		{{ end }}
	</div>
{{ end }}
```

Here was one thing I found. Kind of gives me an idea.

See https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/how-do-i-reference-an-image-in-a-page-bundle/11637/7

Lot's of discussion, including a custom shortcode for including a figure.

Now, I am trying to include an image from a page bundle.

```r
blogdown::shortcode("img", match="example-1.png", figure="Figure 1", caption="green")
```
