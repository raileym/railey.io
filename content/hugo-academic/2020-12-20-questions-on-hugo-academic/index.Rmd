### Can I combine mark-up {{ }} with .Rmd files AND .md files? The context is that I need to execute {{ }} style instructions when I am inside an .Rmd file.

These are called Go Templates. So the question is whether I can run Go Templates from within documents for either R Markdown or Markdown syntax.


----

### Do these files NEED to be called index.this or index.that? 

My problem is that RStudio references these titles inside its editor by using the same name everywhere. All I see across the top is index.this and index.that.

----

### How do I designate a draft page?

I want to designate a draft page so that I can edit a page without posting the
same page for public consumption?

----

### HUGO: Check out, "hugo list XXX"

Separately, check out the expression, hugo list XXX, where XXX can be draft or future (whatever future means).

### How do I highlight text in-line?

Clearly, I need to be using highlight.js. I can't tell whether I should be using
highlight.js directly, through Hugo-Academic, or through Hugo. Of course, I 
couldn't find any references on this topic (either no one asked or no one knows). Then again, I see examples of in-line text highlighting throughout.

I will start again. Apparently, there is no particular method for changing the color of text in-line. The gross recommendation is to state specific HTML syntax, as in here is <span style="color: red;">some highlighted text</span>. For that matter, here is some other <span style="background-color:blue; color: red;">highlighted text</span>, which changes the color of a background, as well.

<svg xmlns="//www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" class="svg-filters" style="display:none;">
  <defs>
    <filter id="marker-shape">
      <feTurbulence type="fractalNoise" baseFrequency="0 0.15" numOctaves="1" result="warp" />
      <feDisplacementMap xChannelSelector="R" yChannelSelector="G" scale="30" in="SourceGraphic" in2="warp" />
    </filter>
  </defs>
</svg>

These are great! Check out the Coding Dude at http://www.coding-dude.com/wp/css/highlight-text-css/.

Here are the assorted highlighter looks:

- <marker>default marker look</marker>
- <marker class='standard'>original marker look</marker>
- <marker class='ribbon'>ribbon marker look</marker>
- <marker class='arrow'>arrow marker</marker>
- <marker class='border-dash-red'>dashed red-line marker</marker>
- <marker class='sketch'>sketch marker</marker>
- <marker class='realistic'>realistic marker</marker>

### How do I invoke a Go Template from an .Rmd file?

Looks like blogdown gives me the means to invoke templates from Hugo.

See https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/content.html

```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode(
  'figure', 
  src='/images/negative-binomial-distribution-example-1.png', 
  title='<strong>Figure 1.</strong> Negative Binomial Distribution.',
  caption='<strong>This is my caption</strong>')
```

#{{< myshortcode_2 >}}

#{{< myshortcode_3 >}}
#Here is some stuff.
#{{< /myshortcode_3 >}}

### How do I add Equation Numbers in my Latex Equations?

Google: R Markdown, add equation numbers to latex

See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52939909/how-can-i-auto-number-math-equations-in-rmarkdown

Use begin{align} end{align} without ANY dollar signs. This is totally weird.

Using TAG works, but it is not automatic. I admit that I like the explicit tag statement, however.

\begin{equation}
Pr[X = x] = { k+r-1 \choose r-1} (1-p)^k p ^ r
\end{equation}

<br/><br/>

\begin{equation}
\tag{2.1}
Pr[X = x] = { k+r-1 \choose r-1} (1-p)^k p ^ r
\end{equation}

<br/><br/>

\begin{align}
N[A] = & k+r-1 \\\\[0.5em]
     = & k + (r-1) \\\\
\end{align}

<br/><br/>

\begin{aligned}
N[A] = & k+r-1 \\\\[0.5em]
     = & k + (r-1) \\\\
\end{aligned}

Also, Bookdown says you can add another expression in your latex equation, as in

\begin{equation} 
  f\left(k\right) = \binom{n}{k} p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}
  (\#eq:binom)
\end{equation} 

By using this form, you can then make a reference back to the equation like this <strong>Equation \@ref(eq:binom)</strong>.

This is it by Bookdown: See https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html#equations

### How do I box a statement, like a definition, wholesale? A nice solid box?

---

### How do I enclose a full statement as a fancy Theorem, Lemma, Corollary, etc.?

See https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html#theorems

```{theorem, name="Pythagorean theorem"}
For a right triangle, if $c$ denotes the length of the hypotenuse
and $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the other two sides, we have
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
```

```{definition, name="Pythagorean theorem"}
For a right triangle, if $c$ denotes the length of the hypotenuse
and $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the other two sides, we have
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
```

### How do I include a style sheet with my website, aside from custom.scss in $(HOME)/assets/scss?

Google: bookdown, include a css style sheet

See https://themes.gohugo.io/anatole/#custom-css

Google: hugo-academic, include a css style sheet

See https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/where-do-we-tell-hugo-about-our-css/619

Perhaps use a new file: layouts/partials/custom_head.html

Google: hugo-academic, include a css file

See https://www.mattmayes.com/posts/2019/hugo-add-custom-css-properly/

----

### How do I include a javascript file with my website? Perhaps specific to a page?

See https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-modules/issues/867
See https://wowchemy.com/docs/customization/#add-scripts-js

GCushion re-shaped is config file. In so doing, he speaks to HOW to manage custom CSS and JS files.

See https://wowchemy.com/docs/customization/#customize-style-css
See https://silvia.rbind.io/2020-06-16-dark-theme-custom-with-atom/

Looks like GCushion changed handling of CSS files AGAIN.
