### Overplotting may distort scatter plots

Scatter plots may have problems with overplotting [@Tidyverse2021] when one point is plotted on top of another. Overplotting distort the information shown, accordingly. 

Approaches by GGPLOT to mitigate overplotting include using

- geom_smooth(), 
- geom_quantile(),
- geom_density_2d(), 
- geom_boxplot(),
- geom_count(), 
- geom_hex(), or 
- geom_density2d().
