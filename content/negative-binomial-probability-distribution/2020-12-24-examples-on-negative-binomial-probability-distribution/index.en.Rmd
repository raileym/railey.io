The following examples illustrate variations of problems where the negative binomial probability distribution applies.

A geological study indicates that an exploratory oil well drilled in a particular region should strike oil with probability $p=1/5$. Find the probability that the third oil strike comes on the fifth well drilled (Wackerly et al., p. 117).

If the third strike occurs on the fifth well, then we have the scenario as depicted in <strong>Figure 1</strong>.

Using the equation

\begin{equation}
P(X = k \ | \ r, p) = { k+r-1 \choose r-1} p^r (1-p)^k 
\end{equation}

where $k$ is the number of failures, $r$ is the number of successes, and $p$ is the probability of success. Plugging in our values as $r=3$ successes, $k=2$ failures, and $p=1/5$ probability of success yields the following result,

\begin{align}
P(X = 2 \ | \ r=3, p=\frac 15) = & { 2+3-1 \choose 3-1} (\frac 15)^3 (1-\frac 15)^2  \\\\
                               = & { 2+3-1 \choose 3-1} (\frac 15)^3 (1-\frac 15)^2  \\\\
                               = & { 4 \choose 2} (\frac 15)^3 (\frac 45)^2 \\\\
                               = & 6(008)(.64) \\\\
                               = & .0307 
\end{align}
