A random variable with a negative binomial probability distribution originates
from a similar context as does a random variable with a geometric distribution.
Both variables are based on the same context:

- The random variable is based on a series of TRIALS. 
- The outcomes of a TRIAL yield exactly one of two results: SUCCESS or FAILURE. 
- The outcomes of a TRIAL are Bernoulli in nature. That is, the outcome of one 
trial is independent of another.
