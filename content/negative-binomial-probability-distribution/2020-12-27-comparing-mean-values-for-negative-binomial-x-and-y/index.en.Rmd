Consider a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials where each trial has two potential outcomes, "success" or "failure". For each trial, the probability of success is $p$, and therefore the probability of failure is $(1 âˆ’ p)$. We observe this sequence until a predefined number $r$ of successes have occurred. 

For this sequence, we let $X$ denote the random number of failures we have seen, and we let $Y$ denote the random number trials we have seen. Both random variables $X$ and $Y$ have a negative binomial distribution.

The mean value for $X$ is given by the expression,

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}[X] = \frac {r(1-p)}{p} .
\end{equation}

The mean value for $Y$ is given by the expression,

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}[Y] = \frac rp .
\end{equation}

If you consider $Y = X + r,$ or $Y - r = X,$ then it easy to change from one mean to the other, i.e., from $\mathbb{E}[Y]$ to $\mathbb{E}[X].$ For example,

\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}[Y] - r = & \ \frac rp - r      \\\\
                  = & \ \frac {r-rp}{p}   \\\\
                  = & \ \frac {r(1-p)}{p} \\\\
                  = & \ \mathbb{E}[X].
\end{align}
