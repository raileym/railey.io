<div id="natural-numbers" class="section level2">
<h2>Natural Numbers</h2>
<p>The simplest of our number types is the set of <strong>Natural Numbers</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, ...\},
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>which is also known as the set of <strong>counting numbers</strong>. Everyone uses Natural Numbers every day for counting–there are 3 sheep in the field–and for ordering, as in No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, and so forth.</p>
{{< spoiler text="<strong>More on Natural Numbers</strong>" >}}
<p>Recognizing Natural Numbers is easy: you see them everywhere.</p>
<p>The trick is to know whether your teacher includes ZERO – the symbol for nothing – in the set of Natural Numbers. Some do, some do not.</p>
<p>Ask your teacher: Does the set of Natural Numbers include ZERO? Yes or No?</p>
<p>I do not include ZERO in the set of Natural Numbers because the notion of ZERO – the symbol for nothing – is a recent creation when compared to counting numbers.</p>

<div id="whole-numbers" class="section level2">
<h2>Whole Numbers</h2>
<p>The set of <strong>Whole Numbers</strong> is the number zero combined with the set of Natural Numbers <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\text{whole numbers} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, ...\}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>

<div id="integers" class="section level2">
<h2>Integers</h2>
<p>The set of Integers is the number zero combined with the set of Natural Numbers and their opposites,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\mathbb{Z} = \{..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>{{< spoiler text="<strong>More on Integers</strong>" >}}
Most likely, you will encounter integers in your homework assignment. That said, pay special attention to whether your teacher says limit your answer to the set of Integers <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span>.</p>
<p>For example, support your teacher asks you for the range of integer values <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> that satisfy the inequality,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
-2 \le x \le 4.
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The correct answer is the set of values,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
x \in {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The value of one-and-a-half (<span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span>) is not in the correct answer set.

<div id="rational-numbers" class="section level2">
<h2>Rational Numbers</h2>
<p>The set of <strong>Rational Numbers</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span> is the set of fractional numbers <span class="math inline">\(p/q\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(p,q\)</span> are integers, divide by zero excepted,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\mathbb{Q} = \{ p/q \ |\  p,q \in \mathbb{Z}, q \ne 0 \}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
