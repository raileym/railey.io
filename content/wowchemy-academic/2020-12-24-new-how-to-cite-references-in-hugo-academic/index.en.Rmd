The question here is, how to cite references using Hugo-Academic.

On my Google search:

 - hugo-academic, references

https://paperpile.com/s/the-hugo-journal-citation-style/
 
Looks like this web reference speaks to how to format your citations in the
first place, including what tool to use to make that happen.

 - hugo-academic, citations
 
https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/citation-style-varied-by-publication-types-in-academic/19701

This web reference refers to problems with citation formats. It doesn't speak
to the 'how', but it does speak to someone's attempt at using the how.

Here, the web reference asks about whether citations are even possible. BINGO, 
gcushion responded.

Indeed, there is a CITE shortcode.

Let's give it a go. Here, CITE refers to setting in place a link to my own
page on my own website. This is NOT the bibliographic type reference that
I am referring to when I ask how to reference a citation, e.g, reference a
journal article.

{{< cite page="/publication/preprint" view="4" >}}

From Bookdown/Blogdown. Let's see if THIS works. I am going to postpone this
for now. I will see how Bookdown/Blogdown handle this topic directly using a
biblatex type technology.
