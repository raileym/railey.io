<p>So you want to be a data scientist? Sounds great! I want to be a data scientist, too. As far back as 2012, Davenport and Patil declared the Data Scientist as the sexiest job of the century.</p>
<p>According to</p>
<p>There are certainly many avenues to learn and practice the art of data science.</p>

<p>This article speaks to the beginnings of LinkedIn at the point when someone (Jonathon Goldman) recognized the potential for identifying the social connections between people. So while LinkedIn engineering team focused on scaling up the technology, Goldman recognized the implied social networking amongst LinkedIn’s users. An early accomplishment of Goldman’s effort is the “People You May Know” click-thru that is based on mining user data for unexpected relationships.</p>

<p><strong>Isn’t academia boring, long, expensive, and out-of-touch?</strong> I fully agree that attending a formal program is long, expensive, and potentially out-of-touch. Nonetheless, I decided to take a formal approach that is rooted in mathematics, not in tools. I really want to understand the math with purpose, not with just a glance – I will decide on my own whether my study is too deep.</p>
<p>As for academia vs industry, I value both equally: academic rigor gives me a firm understanding of ‘why’ and ‘how’ a solution exists; whereas, industry focus gives me a strong sense of purpose and application.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I decided to start my venture into data science formally. I want to go deep on the mathematics and statistics, and then learn the appropriate technologies along the way, not vice versa.</p>
<p><strong>So why not just read a bunch of books?</strong> I know that I can learn data science through any combination of books. On <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/">O’Reilly’s Learning Platform</a> alone, I found nearly 4,000 books with “data science” relevant to their content. Similarly, I found by Google search many a page listing must-read books now: “50 Must-Read Free Books For Every Data Scientist in 2020” <span class="citation">(Verma 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>For me, finding a book is not the problem – it’s knowing where to start that trips me up. That said, I plan to use my formal study as my primary path, and then use supplemental materials along the way.</p>
<p><strong>What about following your own prescribed curriculum?</strong> I agree wholeheartedly: not only will I develop my <em>own</em> path along the way, I will also borrow from the advice of others on the same. In particular, I really like David Venturi’s <span class="citation">(Venturi 2016)</span> planned curriculum. I couldn’t agree more with Venturi’s proposal to study what he wants to study, when he wants to study it, and how.</p>
<p><strong>Why not learn through a technology by doing, not by studying?</strong> I guess so, but I wouldn’t recommend it. I agree that learning through a particular technology grounds you quickly in an application, but doing so also biases you towards a particular train of thought: if all you have is a hammer, then everything looks like a nail. Technologies come and go, if not at least fall into favor or out. I believe that knowing both the why (mathematics, statistics) <em>and</em> the how (technology) is a better, more balanced approach.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t you need a target industry or domain?</strong> I do, but for now I am not targeting a particular industry or domain. I am going to see how that plays out as I go along.</p>
<p><strong>Taking the best from each world.</strong> So there you have it. I plan to use my formal curriculum as my primary path of study, with plans to include suggestions from others on readings and technologies along the way.</p>
