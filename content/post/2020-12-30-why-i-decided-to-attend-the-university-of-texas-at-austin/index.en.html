<p>Once I decided to study data science through a formal academic program, I only had to determine whose program to attend?</p>
<p>Ultimately, I decided to attend the Master of Science in Data Science (MSDS) Online at the University of Texas at Austin. I gave my decision much consideration. Here are the reasons that motivate my choice.</p>
<p><strong>Every course taught in the MSDS program is a course I want to take.</strong> My desired curriculum focuses on using mathematics and statistics, not on using technology. While I value a technical approach to computer science, I don’t believe technology is the starting point for learning data science. As a seasoned computer scientist but a newcomer to data science, I am starting my path with mathematics and applied statistics.</p>
<p>The MSDS curriculum <span class="citation">(UTexas 2021)</span>, as shown below, illustrates the extent to which UT’s program emphasizes mathematics, statistics, and machine learning. I see only courses that <em>use</em> technology, not <em>lead</em> with technology.</p>
<ul>
<li>Probability and Simulation-Based Inference for Data Science</li>
<li>Foundations of Regression and Predictive Modeling</li>
<li>Algorithms: Techniques and Theory</li>
<li>Advanced Predictive Models for Complex Data</li>
<li>Design Principles and Causal Inference for Data-Based Decision Making</li>
<li>Data Exploration, Visualization, and Foundations of Unsupervised Learning</li>
<li>Principles of Machine Learning</li>
<li>Deep Learning</li>
<li>Natural Language Processing</li>
<li>Optimization</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>UT created the MSDS program from the ground-up.</strong> Clearly, the MSDS program stems directly from data science. Namely, I don’t see any traditional classes in this curriculum from either computer science or applied statistics. That is, the MSDS program is not born of a patchwork of pre-existing courses. Consequently, I anticipate the focus of every discussion to target some aspect of data science. I note that there is no mention of tools, programming languages, or frameworks in this curriculum, which I consider a technical risk but a risk I am willing to take.</p>
<p><strong>The MSDS Program costs a FLAT FEE of $10,000.</strong> From my research, no university offers a lower cost Master of Science in Data Science than the University of Texas at Austin, not even Georgia Tech. I consider this pricing disruptive for the industry. While we can all debate the quality of education at one university versus another, we cannot debate the cost. For example, in a recent search, I found the following total costs of a Master of Science in Data Science for eight universities. See Table I below.</p>

<p><strong>Lower cost means more opportunities.</strong> Using my savings, I can travel to Austin for a conference or meet my professors. I can buy more research materials as required. I can attend additional classes in a specialty. Lower cost gives me the flexibility to learn more and take advantage of the opportunities as they arise.</p>
<p><strong>Isn’t the MSDS program too new and untested.</strong> Yes, the MSDS program is brand new, starting in Spring 2021, and as such, the program is untested.</p>
<p>So yes, I will be a course guinea pig for probably the entire year, but then after one year, I will be engaged in a program that will be firing on all pistons. For a math-oriented program by a major university that costs dramatically less than its nearest competitor, I am willing to take that risk.</p>
<p><strong>Austin is an exciting place to visit if ever there is such a reason.</strong> I have no doubt I will visit Austin soon. I want to meet the professors; I want to see the campus; I want to eat the food; I want to hear the music. Besides, I grew up on the UT Austin campus and therefore always appreciate a return visit to my home state of Texas.</p>
<p>While the global pandemic of 2020 was brutal to every city’s economy, I firmly believe Austin, as a mecca for high tech <span class="citation">(Bluestein 2020)</span>, will bounce back in stride, if not with a vengeance.</p>
