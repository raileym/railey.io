<p>For some time, I have been writing software to help kids learn math. After so many years to that end, I decided I needed a change of venue: I like software engineering challenges but need a different path.</p>
<p>Specifically, I need to work on more complicated math and computer science; I want to use new programming languages, tools, and frameworks; and I want to work with various domains.</p>
<p>I believe working in data science will give me a new sense of direction. Plus, doing so will satisfy my work requirements more broadly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work remotely</li>
<li>Work in software engineering</li>
<li>Work in new areas in computer science</li>
<li>Work in a domain with boundless opportunity</li>
<li>Work with challenging math</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Work remotely.</strong> Honestly, I don’t want to move. Of course, I can work locally, but then that would be limiting. Instead, I want to work remotely for whichever company I choose and from wherever I live. Remote work is no longer a limiting choice.</p>
<p><strong>Work in software engineering.</strong> I like software engineering, from writing code to designing new architectures. I need more challenging problems, from working with complexity and uncertainty to solving scale and design problems. And I need more math.</p>
<p>I freely admit that writing production code (software engineering) is both demanding and rewarding. However, writing production code is not where I want to focus my energy; instead, I want to work with something new.</p>
<p><strong>Work in new areas in computer science. </strong> I am ready to give artificial intelligence a try. I want to solve problems across the board: robotics, vision, natural language processing, planning, machine learning, and deep learning. I can combine my effort in artificial intelligence with my experience in software engineering.</p>
<p>I also want to work with data – lots of data. I am speaking about designing structures, writing algorithms, analyzing complexity, and working with architectures for scale and performance.</p>
<p><strong>Work in a domain with boundless opportunity.</strong> When I was a consultant, I always told myself, “there is always room for one in the movie theater.” I don’t need to find the funding for 20 engineers; I only need to find the funding for one (me).</p>
<p>Then again, securing even one seat as a software engineer is hard: you need to write a lot of code. On the other hand, securing a seat as a data scientist could be easy (no production code required): you need a path to a strong recommendation.</p>
<p>Finding the path, not writing the code, is the difference. And, as for finding that path, the sky is the limit.</p>
<p><strong>Work with challenging math.</strong> I like the idea of adding complicated math – applied statistics – to my work results. To that end, I am motivated to learn everything I can about applied statistics, machine learning, deep learning and then use today’s technology to build upon that knowledge. I find it interesting that old topics in statistics are now considered fresh and innovative thanks to technological advances.</p>
<hr />
<p>Separately, I like knowing that the path I want to follow is a data scientist’s path leading to the most desired job. In their article for Harvard Business Review <span class="citation">(Davenport and Patil 2012)</span>, Davenport and Patil describe the data scientist’s position as just that: “Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century.”</p>
<p>In their article, Davenport and Patil describe a point of innovation at LinkedIn when a scientist – Jonathon Goldman – recognized the implied social connections between LinkedIn’s users. Specifically, Goldman recognized the pattern of “triangle closing”, which is to say that “if you know Larry and Sue, there’s a good chance that Larry and Sue know each other” <span class="citation">(Davenport and Patil 2012)</span>. And from that discovery, Goldman and his team gave birth to LinkedIn’s feature, “People You May Know,” which launched LinkedIn onto its meteoric path.</p>
<p>Goldman’s discovery stems from the data, not from the code – my point exactly.</p>
