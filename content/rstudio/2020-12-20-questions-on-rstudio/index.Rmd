### Handle to a key reference

[R Markdown from RStudio](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)

[R Markdown Reference Sheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf)

[Chunk Options from Yihui](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/)
 
Yihui's article on Knitr [@Xie2020c] is the mother load for describing feature of **chunks** in R Studio.

### You can be VERY specific as to instructions to R Chunks

There is far too much information. I need to go piece-by-piece here. See Yihui's article on R Markdown [@Xie2020c].
