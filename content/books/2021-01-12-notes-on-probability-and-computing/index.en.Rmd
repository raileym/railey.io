I understand that the product of two polynomials each of length $n$ requires $n \cdot n = n^2$ multiplications: each element of the first polynomial must be multiplied by each element of the second polynomial. If both polynomials have $n$ terms, then $n \cdot n = n^2$ multiplications are required.

Note that a polynomial of the $d^{th}$ degree has at most $d+1$ terms.

I think what is meant by the final sentence in regards to the time to compute the canonical form $F(r)$ is
that we must first find the canonical form of $F$, and only then compute $F(r)$.

Consider the right-wrong scenarios:

- If $F(x) \equiv G (x)$, then the randomized algorithm will find the correct answer $F(r) = G(r)$ for any value $r$.
- If $F(x) \not\equiv G(x)$ and $F(r) \ne G(r)$ then the randomized algorithm is correct again having found a case where $F(x)$ and $G(x)$ disagree.
- If $F(x) \not\equiv G(x)$ and $F(r) = G(r)$, then the randomized algorithm gives the wrong answer.

In the latter scenario, the randomized algorithm finds $F$ and $G$ are equivalent because it found one value $r$ such that $F(r) = G(r)$. 

> If the random algorithm finds a value $r$ such that $F(r) = G(r)$, then $r$ must be a root of equation $F(x) - G(x)=0$.
