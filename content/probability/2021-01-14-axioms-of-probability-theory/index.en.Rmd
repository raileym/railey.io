# Axioms of Probability

```{definition, "probability-space", name="PROBABILITY SPACE"}
A PROBABILITY SPACE has three components:

  1. a sample space $\Omega$, which is the set of all possible
OUTCOMES of the random process modeled by the probability space;

  2. a family of sets $\mathcal{F}$ representing the allowable EVENTS, 
where each set in $\mathcal{F}$ is a subset of the sample $\Omega$; and;

  3. a probability function  $Pr: \mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ 
that satisfies Definition \@ref(def:probability-function)

```{definition, "probability-function", name="Probability Function"} 
A probability function is any function $Pr:\mathcal{F}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that satisfies the following conditions:
  
  1. for any event $E$, $0 \le Pr(E) \le 1$;

  2. $Pr(\Omega) = 1$;

  3. for any finite or countably infinite sequence  of pairwise  mutually disjoint events $E_1, E_2, E_3, ...,$
  
  \begin{equation}
  Pr \left( \bigcup_{i \ge 1}E_i \right) = \sum_{i \ge 1} Pr(E_i).
  \end{equation}
