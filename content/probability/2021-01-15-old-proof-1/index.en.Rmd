When constructing the proof, it is important to understand the relation of the underlying sets $A$ and $B$. As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:venn-1), a typical venn diagram shows two sets $A$ and $B$ along with their overlap.

The Venn diagram shown in Figure \@ref(fig:venn-1) is not workable when it comes to proving properties for probability, such as Eq. \@ref(eq:prove-this). For the Venn diagram to work, you must divide the union, $A \cup B$, into **mutually disjoint** sets so that we can apply the third condition for a probability function,

> For any finite or countably infinite sequence  of pairwise  mutually disjoint events $E_1, E_2, E_3, ...,$
>  
>   \begin{equation}
>   Pr \left( \bigcup_{i \ge 1}E_i \right) = \sum_{i \ge 1} Pr(E_i).
>   \end{equation}

```{r orig-venn-1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Typical venn diagram for $A \\cup B$", out.width=400}
knitr::include_graphics("images/venn-1.png")
```

```{r orig-venn-2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="$A \\cup B$ as the union of mutually exclusive subsets", out.width=400}
knitr::include_graphics("images/venn-2.png")
```

```{r venn-3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="$A \\cup B$ as the union of different mutually exclusive subsets", out.width=400}
knitr::include_graphics("images/venn-3.png")
```

Before I explain the proof, stating precise definitions of these terms is important. For this proof, we hold true the following definitions and axioms and definitions.
