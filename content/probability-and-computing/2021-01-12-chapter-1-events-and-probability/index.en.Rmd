# Events and Probability

## Application: Verifying Polynomial Identities

> Let $F(x)$ and $G(x)$ be polynomials, where $F(x)$ is the product [of monomials] $F(x) = \prod^d_{i=1} (x - a_i)$ and $G(x)$ is in its canonical form.
> Transforming $F(x)$ to its canonical form by consecutively multiplying the $i^{th}$ monomial with the product of the first $(i-1)$ monomials requires $\Theta(d^2)$ multiplications of coefficients.

I understand that the product of two polynomials each of length $n$ requires $n \cdot n = n^2$ multiplications. Each element of the first polynomial must be multiplied by each element of the second polynomial. If both polynomials have $n$ terms, then their product requires $n \cdot n = n^2$ multiplications.

Note that a polynomial of the $d^{th}$ degree has at most $d+1$ terms.

At this point of the discussion, there is no basis for the value $100d$. The significance of this value comes at the end of the discussion.

I think what is meant by the final sentence in regards to the time to compute the canonical form $F(r)$ is
that we must first find the canonical form of $F$, and only then compute $F(r)$.

Consider the right-wrong scenarios:

> - If $F(x) \equiv G (x)$, then the randomized algorithm will find the correct answer $F(r) = G(r)$ for any value $r$.
> - If $F(x) \not\equiv G(x)$ and $F(r) \ne G(r)$ then the randomized algorithm 
>   is correct again having found a case where $F(x)$ and $G(x)$ disagree.
> - If $F(x) \not\equiv G(x)$ and $F(r) = G(r)$, then the randomized algorithm gives the wrong answer.
>
> In the latter scenario, the randomized algorithm finds $F$ and $G$ are equivalent because 
> it found one value $r$ such that $F(r) = G(r)$.

> If the random algorithm finds a value $r$ such that $F(r) = G(r)$, then $r$ must be a root of equation $F(x) - G(x)=0$. The degree > of the polynomial $F(x) - G(x)$ can be no larger than $d$ and, by the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree $d$ > > can have no more than $d$ roots.

> Thus, if $F(x) \not\equiv G(x)$, then there are no more than $d$ values in the range $\{1, ..., 100d\}$ for which $F(r) = G(r)$.

**BRILLIANT!!!**

## Axioms of Probability

```{definition, "probability-space", name="Probability Space"}
A probability space has three components:

  1. a sample space $\Omega$, which is the set of all possible
OUTCOMES of the random process modeled by the probability space;

  2. a family of sets $\mathcal{F}$ representing the allowable EVENTS, 
where each set in $\mathcal{F}$ is a subset of the sample $\Omega$; and;

  3. a probability function  $Pr: \mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ 
that satisfies Definition \@ref(def:probability-function)

[@Mitzenmacher2017, p. 2]
```

Here, an element of $\Omega$ is called a SIMPLE or ELEMENTARY event. This is to say that $\Omega$ comprises a set of outcomes where the only sense of grouping is where each outcome is grouped by itself into its own set, i.e., a simple event. Groups of outcomes constitute an event, where an event denotes a set of outcomes.

In this example, the sample space (the set of possible outcomes) is the set of integers $\{1, 2, 3, ..., 100d\}$. Any particular choice of an integer $r$ fro this set is a SIMPLE event.

```{definition, "probability-function", name="Probability Function"} 
A probability function is any function $Pr:\mathcal{F}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that satisfies the following conditions:
  
  1. for any event $E$, $0 \le Pr(E) \le 1$;

  2. $Pr(\Omega) = 1$;

  3. for any finite or countably infinite sequence  of pairwise  mutually disjoint events $E_1, E_2, E_3, ...,$
  
  \begin{equation}
  Pr \left( \bigcup_{i \ge 1}E_i \right) = \sum_{i \ge 1} Pr(E_i).
  \end{equation}

  [@Mitzenmacher2017, p. 2]
```

The author notes that they use standard set theory notation when considering events. Namely, they write

\begin{equation}
E_1 \cap E_2
\end{equation}

to denote the occurrence of BOTH events $E_1$ and $E_2$ and they write

\begin{equation}
E_1 \cup E_2
\end{equation}

to denote the occurrence of EITHER events $E_1$ and $E_2$.

Also, the authors write

\begin{equation}
E_1 - E_2
\end{equation}

to denote the occurrence of an event in $E_1$ but not in $E_2$.

And finally, the authors write $\bar{E}$ as shorthand for

\begin{equation}
\Omega - E.
\end{equation}

The notation $\bar{E}$ denotes the complement of $E$.

```{lemma, "union-events", name="Union of two events"}
\begin{equation}
Pr(E_1 \cup E_2) = Pr(E_1) + Pr(E_2) - Pr(E_1 \cap E_2)
\end{equation}

[@Mitzenmacher2017, p. 3]
