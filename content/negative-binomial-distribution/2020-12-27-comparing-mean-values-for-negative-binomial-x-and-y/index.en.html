<p>Consider a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials where each trial has two potential outcomes, “success” or “failure”. For each trial, the probability of success is <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and therefore the probability of failure is <span class="math inline">\((1 − p)\)</span>. We observe this sequence until a predefined number <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> of successes have occurred.</p>
<p>For this sequence, we let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> denote the random number of failures we have seen, and we let <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> denote the random number trials we have seen. Both random variables <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> have a negative binomial distribution.</p>
<p>The mean value for <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is given by the expression,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}[X] = \frac {r(1-p)}{p} .
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The mean value for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is given by the expression,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}[Y] = \frac rp .
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>If you consider <span class="math inline">\(Y = X + r,\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(Y - r = X,\)</span> then it easy to change from one mean to the other, i.e., from <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{E}[Y]\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{E}[X].\)</span> For example,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}[Y] - r = &amp; \ \frac rp - r      \\\\
                  = &amp; \ \frac {r-rp}{p}   \\\\
                  = &amp; \ \frac {r(1-p)}{p} \\\\
                  = &amp; \ \mathbb{E}[X].
\end{align}\]</span></p>
