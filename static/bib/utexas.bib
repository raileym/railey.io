This article speaks to the beginnings of LinkedIn at the point when someone (Jonathon Goldman) recognized the potential for identifying the social connections between people. So while LinkedIn engineering team focused on scaling up the technology, Goldman recognized the implied social networking amongst LinkedIn's users. An early accomplishment of Goldman's effort is the "People You May Know" click-thru that is based on mining user data for unexpected relationships.

The authors drop some names/companies, too, including Intuit and LinkedIn.},
