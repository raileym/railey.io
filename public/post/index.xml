&lt;p&gt;So you want to be a data scientist? Sounds great! I want to be a data scientist, too. As far back as 2012, Davenport and Patil declared the Data Scientist as the sexiest job of the century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are certainly many avenues to learn and practice the art of data science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article speaks to the beginnings of LinkedIn at the point when someone (Jonathon Goldman) recognized the potential for identifying the social connections between people. So while LinkedIn engineering team focused on scaling up the technology, Goldman recognized the implied social networking amongst LinkedIn’s users. An early accomplishment of Goldman’s effort is the “People You May Know” click-thru that is based on mining user data for unexpected relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dataquest.io/blog/learn-data-science/&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://www.dataquest.io/blog/learn-data-science/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://towardsdatascience.com/was-my-data-science-masters-degree-worth-it-6b524dd35b33&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://towardsdatascience.com/was-my-data-science-masters-degree-worth-it-6b524dd35b33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isn’t academia boring, long, expensive, and out-of-touch?&lt;/strong&gt; I fully agree that attending a formal program is long, expensive, and potentially out-of-touch. Nonetheless, I decided to take a formal approach that is rooted in mathematics, not in tools. I really want to understand the math with purpose, not with just a glance – I will decide on my own whether my study is too deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for academia vs industry, I value both equally: academic rigor gives me a firm understanding of ‘why’ and ‘how’ a solution exists; whereas, industry focus gives me a strong sense of purpose and application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I decided to start my venture into data science formally. I want to go deep on the mathematics and statistics, and then learn the appropriate technologies along the way, not vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So why not just read a bunch of books?&lt;/strong&gt; I know that I can learn data science through any combination of books. On &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oreilly.com/&#34;&gt;O’Reilly’s Learning Platform&lt;/a&gt; alone, I found nearly 4,000 books with “data science” relevant to their content. Similarly, I found by Google search many a page listing must-read books now: “50 Must-Read Free Books For Every Data Scientist in 2020” &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(Verma 2020)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, finding a book is not the problem – it’s knowing where to start that trips me up. That said, I plan to use my formal study as my primary path, and then use supplemental materials along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about following your own prescribed curriculum?&lt;/strong&gt; I agree wholeheartedly: not only will I develop my &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; path along the way, I will also borrow from the advice of others on the same. In particular, I really like David Venturi’s &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(Venturi 2016)&lt;/span&gt; planned curriculum. I couldn’t agree more with Venturi’s proposal to study what he wants to study, when he wants to study it, and how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why not learn through a technology by doing, not by studying?&lt;/strong&gt; I guess so, but I wouldn’t recommend it. I agree that learning through a particular technology grounds you quickly in an application, but doing so also biases you towards a particular train of thought: if all you have is a hammer, then everything looks like a nail. Technologies come and go, if not at least fall into favor or out. I believe that knowing both the why (mathematics, statistics) &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the how (technology) is a better, more balanced approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t you need a target industry or domain?&lt;/strong&gt; I do, but for now I am not targeting a particular industry or domain. I am going to see how that plays out as I go along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking the best from each world.&lt;/strong&gt; So there you have it. I plan to use my formal curriculum as my primary path of study, with plans to include suggestions from others on readings and technologies along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why I decided to attend the University of Texas at Austin for my Master of Science in Data Science</title>

&lt;link href=&#34;https://railey.io/rmarkdown-libs/anchor-sections/anchor-sections.css&#34; rel=&#34;stylesheet&#34; /&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://railey.io/rmarkdown-libs/anchor-sections/anchor-sections.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once I decided to pursue a &lt;a href=&#34;https://railey.io/post/why-i-decided-to-pursue-a-degree-in-data-science&#34;&gt;master of science in data science&lt;/a&gt;, I only had to decide whose program to attend? Does this really change the modification date?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I decided to attend the Master of Science in Data Science (MSDS) Online at the University of Texas (UT) at Austin. I gave my decision much consideration. Here are the reasons that motivated my choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every class taught is a class I want to take&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MSDS program was created from the ground-up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Austin is a fun place to visit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every course taught in the MSDS program is a course I want to take.&lt;/strong&gt; In my curriculum, I want to focus on using mathematics and statistics, not on using technology. This is not to say that I don’t value a technical approach to data science; rather, I value a more mathematical approach that uses technology as support. I believe technology is the jump-off point, not the starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The MSDS program was created from the ground-up.&lt;/strong&gt; Clearly, the MSDS program is created for data science from its very beginning. The MSDS program is not a patch-work of courses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every course taught in the MSDS program is a course that should be taught.&lt;/strong&gt; When I compared programs at two major universities, I noticed a strong difference in focus: one curriculum required coursework on technology, but considered statistics optional; while the other required statistics, but considered the technology as support only. Technologies come and go, if not at least fall in favor or out. On the other hand, methods in applied statistics are constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;offered through a major university. I considered several universities, but ultimately decided on studying at the University of Texas at Austin. Although UT Austin’s program is new (I will be joining the inaugural class for Spring 2021), I decided UT’s advantages far outweighed its risks from newness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My program starts Spring 2021. My goal then with this website is to express and organize (for others) all of the details I experience from Day One. I don’t plan to take anything for granted – I plan to document almost everything. Ideally, others in the courses I take can benefit from my notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I did not seriously consider my alma mater, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&lt;/p&gt;
