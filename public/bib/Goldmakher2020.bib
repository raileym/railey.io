abstract = {The goal of this essay is to describe two types of logic: Propositional Calculus (also called 0th order logic) and Predicate Calculus (also called 1st order logic). Both work with propositions and logical connectives, but Predicate Calculus is more general than Propositional Calculus: it allows variables, quantifiers, and relations.},
