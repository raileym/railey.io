To answer this question you must first understand the concept of slope. Think of slope as you would climbing a mountain: when you climb up: The slope of your climb is <em>positive</em>; when you climb down: The slope of your climb is <em>negative</em>. The same is true for the slope of a line. Always consider the slope of the line from one direction only, e.g., from left to right.
