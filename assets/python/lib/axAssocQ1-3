Addition for real numbers is associative for any three real numbers $$a,$$ $$b,$$ and $$c,$$ $|(a + b) + c = a + (b + c).|$

To answer this question you must first know the <strong>property of associativity</strong> for real numbers under addition, which says for three real numbers $$a,$$ $$b,$$ and $$c$$ you can change the order of addition using parentheses and still get the same sum, $|(a + b) + c = a + (b + c).|$Try this property for yourself using three arbitrary real numbers $$a$$, $$b$$, and $$c$$.
