Addition for integers is associative for any three integers $$a,$$ $$b,$$ and $$c,$$ $|(a + b) + c = a + (b + c).|$

To answer this question you must first know the <strong>property of associativity</strong> for integers under addition, which says for three integers $$a,$$ $$b,$$ and $$c$$ you can change the order of addition using parentheses and still get the same sum, $|(a + b) + c = a + (b + c).|$Try this property for yourself using three arbitrary integers $$a$$, $$b$$, and $$c$$.
