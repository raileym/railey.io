Multiplication for integers is associative for any three integers $$a,$$ $$b,$$ and $$c,$$ $|(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c).|$

To answer this question you must first know the <strong>property of associativity</strong> for integers under multiplication, which says for three integers $$a,$$ $$b,$$ and $$c$$ you can change the order of multiplication using parentheses and still get the same product, $|(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c).|$Try this property for yourself using three arbitrary integers $$a$$, $$b$$, and $$c$$.
