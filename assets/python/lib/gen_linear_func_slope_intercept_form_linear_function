The <strong>Slope-Intercept Form</strong> of a linear function is given by the equation, $|y = mx + b,|$ for all $$x,y \in \mathbb{R}$$ and where $$m$$ is the slope of the line, and $$b$$ is the $$y$$-intercept.

The Slope-Intercept Form of a linear function is given by the equation, why equals emm times x plus bee -- for all real numbers -- x and y -- where emm is the slope of the line -- and bee is the why intercept.
