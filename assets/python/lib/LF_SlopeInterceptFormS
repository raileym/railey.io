Slope-Intercept Form --- Linear Function
    [/ctns_frontspeak]
    
    [ctns_backspeak]
The Slope-Intercept Form of a linear function is given by the equation,
why equals emm times x plus bee --
for all real numbers -- x and y -- where emm is the slope of the line -- and
bee is the why intercept.

The <strong>Slope-Intercept Form</strong> of a linear function is given by the equation,
$|y = mx + b,|$
for all $$x,y \in \mathbb{R}$$ and where $$m$$ is the slope of the line, and $$b$$ is the $$y$$-intercept.
