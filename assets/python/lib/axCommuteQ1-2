Addition for integers is commutative for any two integers $$a$$ and $$b$$, $|a+b = b+a.|$

To answer this question you must first know the <strong>property of commutativity</strong> for integers under addition, which says you can swap the order of addition for any two integers $$a$$ and $$b$$ and still get the same sum, $|a+b=b+a.|$ Try this property for yourself using two arbitrary integers $$a$$ and $$b$$.
