Addition for natural numbers is commutative for any two natural numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$, $|a+b = b+a.|$

To answer this question you must first know the <strong>property of commutativity</strong> for natural numbers under addition, which says you can swap the order of addition for any two natural numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$ and still get the same sum, $|a+b=b+a.|$ Try this property for yourself using two arbitrary natural numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$.
